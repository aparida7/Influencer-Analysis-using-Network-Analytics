# Influencer-Analysis-using-Network-Analytics


**Project Overview**
In this project, we utilized the tweets activity data of different users to identify the top 20 influencers among all the users. We also explore how profits change when a retailer uses the analytical model to identify influencers to promote their product vs selecting influencers randomly through a hypothetical scenario.

**Part-1**
We utilized a Kaggle dataset containing tweets data to build a model to predict influencers. Each observation in the dataset describes two individuals A and B. 'Choice' column in each row shows who among A or B are more influential. Choice = “1” implies A is more influential than B. Choice = “0” implies B is more influential than A. Using this dataset, we created analytics models to classify influencers and identified the best predictors of influence.

**Part-2**
We utilised another file containing tweets of different users. We calculate the influence scores using the of best model from Part 1 and concepts of network analytics to identify the top 20 influencers.

**Tools Used**

**Business Use Case**
Businesses can leverage the insights from our model whenever there is a new product launch or a new Social Media Marketing Campaign by identifying the most influential individuals as predicted by the model who can influence a larger population. This will enable them to maximize their outreach as well as return on investments.
